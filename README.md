##Software Testing Project:

Shipping & Receiving Cargo SystemProject OverviewThe Shipping & Receiving Cargo System is designed to facilitate efficient cargo management, ensuring smooth operations for shipping companies. The system includes features such as shipment tracking, cargo status updates, automated invoicing, and integration with third-party logistics providers.

Testing MethodologiesThe following software testing techniques were applied to ensure the reliability and functionality of the system:

1. Black-Box TestingFocuses on testing the system's functionality without examining internal code structure.
   
Key test cases:

Verify successful cargo booking.
Validate shipment tracking updates.
Ensure proper invoice generation.
Test invalid inputs for cargo weight and dimensions.

3. White-Box TestingExamines internal logic, code structure, and flow.
Key focus areas:

Unit testing of core modules (e.g., cargo management, invoicing, tracking APIs).
Code coverage analysis to ensure maximum path coverage.
Debugging logical errors in the calculation of shipping costs.

5. Integration TestingEnsures that different system components work together seamlessly.
   
Key test cases:

Data synchronization between the shipping database and user dashboards.
Validation of payment gateway integration for invoicing.

7. Acceptance TestingConfirms that the system meets business and user requirements.
Key areas covered:

End-to-end workflow from cargo booking to delivery.
User interface usability and accessibility testing.
Performance testing under high transaction loads.

9. Regression TestingEnsures that new code changes do not negatively impact existing functionality.
    
Automated test scripts executed after every major update.

Agile Framework & Scrum Reports

This project followed the Agile framework for iterative development and testing. Scrum reports were created using JIRA to track progress, manage sprints, and document issues efficiently. Daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospective meetings were conducted to ensure continuous improvement and collaboration.
ConclusionThis project ensures that the Shipping & Receiving Cargo System is fully functional, secure, and user-friendly. The comprehensive testing approach enhances system reliability, improves user satisfaction, and ensures smooth cargo management operations.
